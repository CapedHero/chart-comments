# Chart Comments

+ This project is a simple example of a web application that displays a chart
  that users can comment on.

+ Chart Comments are intended to be used as a starting point for building a 
  more complex application.

+ As a bonus, the code can be used as a template for building any other 
  React + FastAPI web application.

## Requirements

+ [x] Choose a single chart type you would like to work with.
  + Chosen option: bar chart

+ [x] Display the chart on the frontend using a library of your choice.
  + Chosen chart library: [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3)

+ [x] When you click on a data point, show a comments menu.

+ [x] Show comments count on each data point when no data is selected.

+ [x] The comment add form should have username and comment fields.

## Technical Constraints & Guidelines

+ [x] Python + FastAPI for the backend.

+ [x] React/Typescript + your choice data store for frontend.
  + Chosen data store: [Redux](https://redux.js.org)

+ [x] Take a minimal approach to the task, no need to use DB/authentication, 
  error reporting, Docker, etc.

+ [x] Use static mock for the chart data on the backend.

+ [x] We expect you to use TDD for core backend logic and structure commits as 
  if you were working on a real+life project.

+ [x] Use your own judgement to define a scope of a Minimal Lovable Product.

+ [x] Prepare to discuss scalability design during the technical interview 
  calls.
